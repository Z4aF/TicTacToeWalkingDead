# TicTacToeWalkingDead

## Game Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe Walking Dead can be a story-driven and a classic two-player 
game where you can play with a friend or play against the computer. The 
game offers three modes, the story mode, the practice mode, and the two 
player mode. The practice mode is playing against the computer in three
different difficulties, easy, medium, and expert difficulties. The two-
player mode is where you play against a friend or another user.

The story mode follows the story of the walking dead's protagonist 
Rick Grimes. Everytime Rick faces off against a walker or an enemy, a game
of tic-tac-toe appears. If you win, the story progresses but if you lose, 
Rick dies and that means game over.
