# TicTacToeWalkingDead

## Game Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe Walking Dead can be a story-driven and a classic two-player 
game where you can play with a friend or play against the computer. The 
game offers three modes, the story mode, the practice mode, and the two-player
mode. The practice mode is playing against the computer in three
different difficulties, easy, medium, and expert difficulties. The two-player 
mode is where you play against a friend or another user.

The story mode follows the story of the walking dead's protagonist 
Rick Grimes. Everytime Rick faces off against a walker or an enemy, a game
of tic-tac-toe appears. If you win, the story progresses but if you lose, 
Rick dies and that means game over.
